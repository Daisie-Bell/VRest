## Introduction

VRest is a Python library for making HTTP and WebSocket requests to RESTful and WebSocket-based APIs. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for interacting with various APIs, allowing you to send requests and receive responses.

| Problem Statement | Solution |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| APIs are a common way to interact with web services and applications. However, they can be difficult to use, especially when they require complex authentication or use WebSocket connections. VRest simplifies API interaction by providing a clean and flexible interface for making HTTP and WebSocket requests. | VRest provides a `RestAPI` class that you can use to interact with various APIs. It allows you to easily make HTTP and WebSocket requests and handle responses and errors. You can use it to communicate with RESTful and WebSocket-based APIs, including those that require complex authentication. |
